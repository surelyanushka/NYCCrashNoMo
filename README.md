## **Project Overview**

The "NYC Car Crash Detection" project is a sophisticated predictive model designed to identify high-risk traffic accident zones across New York City. Leveraging a rich dataset of traffic patterns, weather conditions, and historical crash data, this project aims to enhance urban safety initiatives by providing actionable insights to city planners and traffic safety management authorities.

## **Key Features**

- **Predictive Modeling**: Developed using Apache Spark and a Random Forest algorithm, achieving a 0.72 F1 score, which underscores its effectiveness.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Deployed using Streamlit, this dashboard offers real-time insights into traffic conditions and accident probabilities, facilitating better decision-making for urban safety.

## **Technologies Used**

- Apache Spark
- Dask ML
- Random Forest Algorithm
- Streamlit

## **Dataset**

The model integrates diverse datasets including:

- Traffic Data
- Weather conditions
- Historical crash data
- Road Network Data
- Infrastructural Data

These datasets were meticulously analyzed to train the predictive model and ensure its accuracy and reliability in identifying accident hotspots.
